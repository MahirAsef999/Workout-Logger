        <p>
          Hello! I'm Mahir, a Computer Science major and a junior at Fordham University. I created Fitness Haven as a personal project to combine my interests in tech and fitness.
        </p>
        <p>
          What inspired me to create this app was my journey of starting to go to the gym. I had recently gotten into the gym and I realized that having a ditigal tracking log helped me track my progress, as I would be able to record my exercises and will not lose it like I would if I had a paper log. I believe that tracking workouts digitally is an essential habit that helps maintain consistency and monitor progress. This app serves as a tool for anyone on a fitness journey, helping you stay motivated and track your improvements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fitness Haven is designed to be simple, intuitive, and motivating. I hope it helps you as much as it has helped me in maintaining my workout routine.
